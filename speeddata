-- STARTING DATA
-- lists for particle structure
-- Average times:
-- creation - 238us
-- update   - 1365us
-- render   - 926us

-- vectors for particle structure, swap trick for removal 
-- iterators replaced in favor of using index into vector
-- much larger speed improvement than I would've thought.
-- See improvements to render from ditching the iterator and using
-- index variable instead, as well as in update.
-- Creation time seems to have increased slightly
-- creation - 252us   (1.05x)
-- update   - 1137us  (0.83x)
-- render   - 820us   (0.89x)
